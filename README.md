# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone


### Week 1:
**Peer-graded Assignment: Setting up Github Account for The Project**\
In this assignment, you will be asked to create a new repository on your Github account, and to create a Jupyter Notebook and submit a shareable link to it for peer evaluation.


### Week 2:
**Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - Car accident severity (Week 1)**\
Here, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the accident data that you found to predict the different accidents' severity. Make sure to provide sufficient justification of why your solution is valid and why would your community or a group of people be interested in your project.\

This capstone project will be graded by your peers. This capstone project is worth 70% of your total grade. The project will be completed over the course of 2 weeks. Week 1 submissions will be worth 30% whereas week 2 submissions will be worth 40% of your total grade.
\
For this week, you will required to submit the following:
+ A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (15 marks)\
+ A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (15 marks)
\
For the second week, the final deliverables of the project will be:
+ A link to your Notebook on your Github repository, showing your code. (15 marks)\
+ A full report consisting of all of the following components (15 marks):
\
Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.\
Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.\
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.\
Results section where you discuss the results.\
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.\
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.\
3. Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (10 marks)


### Week 3 :
**Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - Car accident severity (Week 2)**\
In this week, you will continue working on your capstone project. Please remember by the end of this week, you will need to submit the following:

A full report consisting of all of the following components (15 marks):\
Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.\
Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.\
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.\
Results section where you discuss the results.\
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.\
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.\
2. A link to your Notebook on your Github repository pushed showing your code. (15 marks)

3. Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (10 marks)

Here are examples of previous outstanding submissions that should give you an idea of what your report would look like, what your notebook would look like in terms of clean, clear, and well-commented code, and what your presentation would look like or your blogpost would look like:
